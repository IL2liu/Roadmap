        <p>Logarithmic progression of TCGA files counted using the SPARQL endpoint developed as part of the preliminary work. This particular query can be accessed at http://bit.ly/TcgaNewFiles to update this figure which describes a sustained doubling of the number of files every 7 months for the last 2 ½ years, now reaching over ¼ million individual files in the public domain.</p>

        <p>Results of querying TCGA contents (presently 253,968 files, see Figure 1) for platforms and tumor types. This query can be updated through preliminary work SPARQL endpoint at http://bit.ly/JqDFBA. This specific result can also be shared, for example, using Google Fusion Tables (Gonzalez 2010): http://bit.ly/I23Uyb. The blue nodes represent platforms and the orange nodes indicate the tumor types. The lines between a platform and a tumor type indicate that there are files produced by that platform for that tumor type. Glioblastoma (GBM) is highlighted and, as a consequence, so are the lines for the platforms that were used to process those samples. Each of these linked platforms also represents a possible route to match an external result (obtained with that platform) for an unclassified sample, such as a tumor sample, a xenoline or a cell line. See Table 1 for query formulation.</p>
